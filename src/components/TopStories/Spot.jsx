              Yes, dogs can eat apples. Apples are an excellent source of
              vitamins A and C, as well as fiber for your dog. They are low in
              protein and fat, making them the perfect snack for senior dogs.
              Just be sure to remove the seeds and core first. Try them frozen
              for an icy warm weather snack. You can also find it as an
              ingredient in apple-flavored dog treats.

              Veterinarians recommend that the best defense is a good offense –
              and that you thoroughly check your dog for ticks as soon as you
              return from outside. Carefully run your hands all over your dog to
              search for small bumps. You don’t have to take your dog to the vet
              if you find a tick on them – as long as you know how to safely
              remove the whole tick, including the head, with fine-point
              tweezers or a specially designed tick removal hook. “If the tick
              has been attached for about 48 hours, it can transmit a disease,
              such as Lyme disease, or cause an infection, so that’s why you
              should check your dog and yourself as soon as you get inside,”
              says Dr. Jerry Klein, the AKC’s Chief Veterinary Officer. “Do
              watch your dog for changes in behavior – lack of appetite, low
              energy, joint pain – and if the dog shows signs of being ill, make
              an appointment with your veterinarian.”

              Ticks can be tricky to find on your dog. Ticks can be anywhere,
              but are generally hiding in one of seven areas, so be sure to
              check your dog thoroughly in these places.

            <p className="py-6 text-2xl text-gray-900  dark:text-white font-medium">
              Dogs are curious creatures, sticking their heads into everything,
              so it’s not uncommon for ticks to find their way onto the head and
              into a dog’s ears. With so many crevices and hiding places, the
              ears make a perfect home for a hungry tick. When checking your
              dog, make sure to look on the outside of the ears and also deep
              into the ear, because the ticks can get attached and go unnoticed
              for a long time. If your dog is shaking their head and scratching
              at their ear, it’s a sure sign that something is off, and you’ll
              want to take a look.

              Since ticks hide in places where they won’t be found, crawling in
              between your dog’s toes and attaching there is a common
              occurrence. You can find them in between the toes or even on the
              bottom of the foot near the pads. If you notice your dog licking
              or chewing their feet, there might be something bothering them,
              and that something could be a tick.

              Ticks like dark, moist areas, so the underside of the tail makes a
              great home. Since most owners aren’t regularly checking the
              underside of the dog’s tail, especially near the base, a tick can
              go unnoticed for quite some time. If your dog has thick fur,
              you’ll want to make sure to comb through it and search thoroughly.
              A fine comb will likely catch a tick that’s attached itself under
              the tail.

              Most dog owners aren’t keen on checking their dog’s genital
              regions. However, this area is another dark, moist region on the
              body that ticks really like hanging around in. Ticks can become
              attached and stay hidden 3y the dog’s coat and tail for a long
              time.

            <p className="py-6 text-2xl text-gray-900  dark:text-white font-medium">
              A lot of ticks go unnoticed near the eyelids because they’re
              mistaken for skin tags or eye discharge. Unfortunately, by the
              time many owners realize there is a tick on their dog’s eyelid,
              the tick has been attached for quite a while. This isn’t ideal,
              because the longer a tick stays attached, the more likely
              transmission of disease is to occur.

            <p className="py-6 text-2xl text-gray-900  dark:text-white font-medium">
              Many dogs rarely have their collars taken off, and with good
              reason — it’s important to keep proper identification on your dog
              at all times. Ticks can become attached underneath your dog’s
              collar without anyone noticing, usually until the tick is large
              enough to be seen — which means it’s been there for a while.
              Sometimes, removing and checking the collar itself will prevent a
              tick from attaching if it’s just crawling around underneath.
              Whatever the case, removing the collar to do a thorough check for
              ticks is important.

            <p className="py-6 text-2xl text-gray-900  dark:text-white font-medium">
              Another common place for ticks to attach is high up where the
              dog’s front legs meet their body – what we would call the armpit
              region. It’s a nice, dark area where it’s difficult for the dog to
              reach or for you to see.
