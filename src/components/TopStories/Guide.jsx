              We read about so many different dog vaccinations, for so many
              different illnesses, that it can sometimes be confusing to know
              which vaccinations puppies need and which puppy shots are
              important but optional. Here is an overview of the diseases that
              puppy vaccinations will help your pet avoid.

              This highly infectious bacterium causes severe fits of coughing,

              Canine Distemper
            </p>
            <p className="py-6 text-2xl text-gray-900  dark:text-white font-medium">
              A severe and contagious disease caused by a virus that attacks the
              respiratory, gastrointestinal (GI), and nervous systems of dogs,
              raccoons, skunks, and other animals, distemper spreads through
              airborne exposure (through sneezing or coughing) from an infected
              animal. The virus can also be transmitted by shared food and water
              bowls and equipment. It causes discharges from the eyes and nose,
              fever, coughing, vomiting, diarrhea, seizures, twitching,
              paralysis, and, often, death. This disease used to be known as
              “hard pad” because it causes the footpad to thicken and harden.
              <br />
              <br />
              There is no cure for distemper. Treatment consists of supportive
              care and efforts to prevent secondary infections, control symptoms
              of vomiting, seizures and more. If the animal survives the
              symptoms, it is hoped that the dog’s immune system will have a
              chance to fight it off. Infected dogs can shed the virus for
              months.

              Canine HepatitisInfectious canine hepatitis is a highly contagious
              viral infection that affects the liver, kidneys, spleen, lungs,
              and the eyes of the affected dog. This disease of the liver is
              caused by a virus that is unrelated to the human form of
              hepatitis. Symptoms range from a slight fever and congestion of
              the mucous membranes to vomiting, jaundice, stomach enlargement,
              and pain around the liver. Many dogs can overcome the mild form of
              the disease, but the severe form can kill. There is no cure, but
              doctors can treat the symptoms.

              The canine coronavirus is not the same virus that causes COVID-19
              in people. COVID-19 is not thought to be a health threat to dogs,
              and there is no evidence it makes dogs sick. Canine coronavirus
              usually affects dogs’ gastrointestinal systems, though it can also
              cause respiratory infections. Signs include most GI symptoms,
              including loss of appetite, vomiting, and diarrhea. Doctors can
              keep a dog hydrated, warm, and comfortable, and help alleviate
              nausea, but no drug kills coronaviruses.

              Heartworm
            </p>
            <p className="py-6 text-2xl text-gray-900  dark:text-white font-medium">
              When your puppy is around 12-to-16 weeks, talk to your vet about
              starting a heartworm preventive medication. Though there is no
              vaccine for heartworm in dogs, it is preventable with regularly
              administered heartworm medication that your veterinarian will
              prescribe.
              <br />
              <br />
              The name is descriptive — these worms lodge in the right side of
              the heart and the pulmonary arteries (that send blood to the
              lungs), though they can travel through the rest of the body and
              sometimes invade the liver and kidneys. The worms can grow to 14
              inches long and, if clumped together, block and injure organs.
              <br />
              <br />A new heartworm infection often causes no symptoms, though
              dogs in later stages of the disease may cough, become lethargic,
              lose their appetite or have difficulty breathing. Infected dogs
              may tire after mild exercise. Unlike most of the conditions listed
              here, which are passed by urine, feces, and other body fluids,
              heartworms are transmitted by mosquitoes. Therefore, diagnosis is
              made via a blood test and not a fecal exam.

            </p>
            <p className="py-6 text-2xl text-gray-900  dark:text-white font-medium">
              Unlike the famous “bull’s-eye” rash that people exposed to Lyme
              disease often spot, no such telltale symptom occurs in dogs. Lyme
              disease (or borreliosis) is an infectious, tick-borne disease
              caused by a type of bacteria called a spirochete. Transmitted via
              ticks, an infected dog often starts limping, his lymph nodes
              swell, his temperature rises, and he stops eating. The disease can
              affect his heart, kidney, and joints, among other things, or lead
              to neurological disorders if left untreated. If diagnosed quickly,
              a course of antibiotics is extremely helpful, though relapses can
              occur months or even years later.
              <br />
              <br />
              Talk to your vet about when your puppy will be old enough for tick
              preventatives. Once your puppy is old enough, keep your dog on
              tick preventative medication, topicals, or wearables to help stop
              ticks from biting in the first place.

              Rabies is a viral disease of mammals that invades the central

              Treatment within hours of infection is essential, otherwise, death
              is highly likely. Most states require regular rabies vaccinations.

              How Much Do Puppy Vaccinations Cost?

            <p className="py-6 text-2xl text-gray-900  dark:text-white font-medium">
              How much puppy vaccinations will cost depends on several factors.
              Where you live is a big one: Veterinarians in crowded and
              expensive urban areas will generally charge more than a rural vet
              in a small town. You may be able to find low-cost clinics
              providing rabies vaccinations sponsored by your local municipal
              government. But no matter what the range in costs, some vaccines,
              such as the “core vaccines” and rabies, are necessary.

              >
                <li>The average cost can average around $75—100. These will include the core vaccines, which are administered in a series of three: at 6-, 12-, and 16 weeks old.</li>
                <li>The core vaccines include the DHLPP (distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parvo, and parainfluenza). Your pup will also need a rabies vaccination, which is usually around $15—20. (Some clinics include the cost of the rabies vaccination.) </li>

            Vaccinations for Adult Dogs: Boosters and Titers
            </p>
            <p className="py-6 text-2xl text-gray-900  dark:text-white font-medium">
            There is a difference of opinion about having your adult dog vaccinated every year. Some vets believe too many vaccinations in adult dogs pose health risks. But others disagree, saying that yearly vaccinations will prevent dangerous diseases such as distemper. Talk with your vet to determine what kind of vaccination protocol works for you and your dog.
              <br />
              <br />
              Many dog owners opt for titer tests before they administer annual vaccinations. Titer tests measure a dog’s immunity levels, and this can determine which, if any, vaccinations are necessary. One key exception to this is rabies: a titer test is not an option when it comes to the rabies vaccine. This vaccination is required by law across the United States. Your vet can tell you the schedule for your particular state, with boosters often lasting three years.Talk with your veterinarian about more information and guidance on
              necessary and optional vaccinations.
              <br /><br />
              And it’s all worth it. For your effort and care your puppy will lavish you with lifelong love in return. This critical first year of her life is a fun and exciting time for both of you. As she grows physically, the wonderful bond between you will grow, too.
